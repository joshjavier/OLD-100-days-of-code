# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com) -->

## Why am I doing this?

I've always wanted to write a blog... and code, and draw, and learn a bunch of fun things that don't seem to materialize. I want to do a lot of things, but I lack the **focus** to *actually* do them - or at least try.

So my overarching goal for doing #100DaysOfCode is to practice self-discipline by making time to do the things I want to do. Specifically, I aim to:

* learn the basics of web dev & design through freeCodeCamp's **Responsive Web Design Certication**
* come up with a working blog or personal site (Jekyll, maybe?)
* connect more with the coding community

### Day 0: October 27, 2019 ðŸš€ Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Set up this GitHub repo.

**Thoughts**: Get more confident with using Git. I have an idea of the workflow, but I needed to double check before pressing Enter to see if I was using the right parameters. Make more mistakes - it will speed up the learning process.

### Day 1: November 3, 2019 ~ Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Started developing my personal site using Jekyll.

**Thoughts**: I've been in a rut recently, anxiety and perfectionism preventing me from continuing my coding journey. After reading a [blog post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-a-developer-job-in-less-than-a-year-c27bbfe71645/) by Alexander Kallaway (creator of #100DaysOfCode challenge), I got inspired to push through, knowing that what I'd come up with this day might suck, but it's fine, because I'll work on it again the next day, and the day after that, and so on, continuously improving with every iteration.

That's when I realized: this challenge is not just about learning how to code, but also about realizing the value of small, consistent work over big, sporadic effort.

**Notes:**
* Practice Vim to use it more seamlessly
* I'm surprised how intuitive Vim is: automatic indenting, syntax highlighting, screen flashes when it detects a syntax error (I thought it was just broken lol)
* Interplay of Git and Jekyll (files to include in gitignore, pushing local repo to GitHub)
* `ls -R` - list all files, including subdirectories (recursively)
* `pwd` - print working directory
* `mkdir` - create a directory (folder)
* `touch` - create a file (use mkdir first to create a new folder, then use `touch <dir>/<file>`)

### Day 2: November 4, 2019 ~ Monday

**Today's progress:** Reviewed Jekyll mechanics, pushed my personal site to a remote GitHub repo.

**Thoughts:** A little slow today as I mostly just repeated what I did yesterday, but with more understanding of what each command does and how stuff works.

Since I'm also practicing Git, I copied an idea from a project that uses two branches: `master` and `develop` (turns out this is a [best practice in Git branching](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)).

### Day 3-4: November 5-6, 2019 ~ Tue-Wed

**Today's progress:** Read Git Pro (I'm on [chapter 2.3](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History), learned [a little bit of regex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgBWp9EIlMM), and continued learning Jekyll.

**Thoughts:** I planned to finish Jekyll's Step by Step Tutorial (I'm already on [Collection](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/09-collections/)), but I actually fell asleep during a break. That's good because it means I'm not lacking in the motivation department, but I should watch my energy lest I should burn out.

* [Let Jekyll --watch](https://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/4-wdm-gem/) -- check out if you have time to learn about the `wdm` gem (message "please add the following to your gemfile" when I'm running `build exec jekyll serve`)
* Learn more about [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

### Day 5: November 9, 2019 ~ Saturday

**Today's progress:** Finished vimtutor! ðŸŽ‰

**Thoughts:** I realized that vimtutor is just the tip of the iceberg, and there are better/faster ways of doing things (like `D` and `C` instead of `d$` and `c$`, respectively)

I also got confused with my setup because I was using Vim via Git Bash (which came with Git installation), but I was referencing the vimrc in the standalone Vim I installed separately. **Opportunity for learning**, but had to stop because I was getting obsessed with optimizing my vimrc instead of actually coding.

Some notes:
- Are vimrc files inherited? i.e. configs in system vimrc are inherited to user vimrc (my guess is no. I found a [workaround](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/423301/extend-default-configuration-of-vim) and [why `:runtime` is better than `:source`](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/9250/includes-in-vimrc) )
- Should I just use Vim that comes with Git Bash? Or is it better to use Windows-native Vim? (extending Vim with plugins like Powerline, etc.)

**Resources:**
- [The Vim book](http://www.truth.sk/vim/vimbook-OPL.pdf) by Steve Oualline -- further reading in vimtutor
- [Other Vim books](https://iccf-holland.org/vim_books.html) via [Bram Moolenaar's site](https://moolenaar.net/) (creator of Vim) -- also check out "Learning the Vi and Vim Editors" which is the other book mentioned in vimtutor

- [Vim Training Class 1 - Basic motions and commands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nim4_f5QUxA) by Shawn Biddle

### Day 6: November 10, 2019 ~ Saturday

**Today's progress:** Finished Jekyll's Step by Step Tutorial. Came up with a basic Vim configuration that I like.

**Resources (mostly about Vim):**
- [Indenting source code](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Indenting_source_code)
- [Vim indentation recommendations w/ example](https://superuser.com/a/782592)
- [What is `softtabstop` used for?](https://vi.stackexchange.com/q/4244)

- [Vim tab indent,change tab character](https://youtu.be/M-IqFOjY7Pk)
- [RubyGems version specifiers](https://guides.rubygems.org/patterns/#pessimistic-version-constraint)

**Thoughts:** It's been roughly a week since I started #100DaysofCode, and I feel the initial motivation boost starting to fade. So far, I learned how Jekyll, Git, and Vim works -- just enough to be able to confidently open up Git Bash and make commits without looking up if I'm typing the right command.

However, I also noticed some smol things that can be improved:
- I usually code after work, which is not a good time for the brain to absorb and retain new information. A few times I fell asleep without posting an update on Twitter, and even skipped two days this week.
- I tend to go beyond the 1-hour minimum (which is good?) but this lack of limitation causes me to follow every rabbit hole I find, which is frankly unproductive. Yes, I learned about the [Tabs v. Spaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoOG6ZeyUI) debate among coders, and whether to use 2 or 4 spaces for indents, but I think I could've made faster progress if I were forced to focus for a limited amount of time.

**Goals for next week:**
- come up with an "MVP" for my personal site
- start freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification

### Day 7: November 11, 2019 ~ Monday

**Today's progress:** 1/8 modules done from freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification. Next up: [Basic CSS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-css/)

**Thoughts:** Shifted to coding at the start of the day, before going to work. Hopefully I'll feel less burned out after every session. This also forces me to set a time limit and make productive use of it.

**Resources:**
Today's reading focused on custom domains
- [Using an apex domain for your GitHub Pages site](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages#using-an-apex-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)

- [What should a professional domain email address look like?](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/7bndtw/best_domain_registrar_top_recommendations/)

### Day 8: November 12, 2019 ~ Tuesday

**Today's progress:** âœ” Basic CSS (2/8 modules from fCC's Responsive Web Design Certification). New learnings: CSS variables, :root selector

Next up: [Applied Visual Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design)

**Thoughts:** I feel uneasy just doing a freeCodeCamp course, like I feel I have to continue working on a project on the side to serve as practical application, not just theory. I guess I'm in a dilemma: on one hand I want to keep iterating on my personal site, but on the other I think I should hold off until I have learned new knowledge that will allow me to do it better. Such is the perfectionism paralysis...

But since the next module is about visual design, I'll create a "version 0" of my site after that.
