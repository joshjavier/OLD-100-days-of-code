# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

## Why am I doing this?

I've always wanted to write a blog... and code, and draw, and learn a bunch of fun things that don't seem to materialize. I want to do a lot of things, but I lack the **focus** to *actually* do them - or at least try.

So my overarching goal for doing #100DaysOfCode is to practice self-discipline by making time to do the things I want to do. Specifically, I aim to:

* learn the basics of web dev & design through freeCodeCamp's **Responsive Web Design Certication**
* come up with a working blog or personal site (Jekyll, maybe?)
* connect more with the coding community

**Today's Progress**: Set up this GitHub repo.

**Thoughts**: Get more confident with using Git. I have an idea of the workflow, but I needed to double check before pressing Enter to see if I was using the right parameters. Make more mistakes - it will speed up the learning process.
